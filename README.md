## Background

This project contains a simple setup wherein data pushed to Tableland Basin (replicated to Filecoin) is fetched and computed over with the [Bacalhau](https://www.bacalhau.org/) network.

> Note: this is a demo project, and is not intended for production use. It is a WIP and does not contain the full suite of features noted above and simply runs a `"hello world"` job.

## Install

To set things up on your machine, you'll need to do the following:

1. Run: `python -m venv env`.
2. Source: `source env/bin/activate`

Then, you can use the `Makefile` command to install dependencies: `make install`.

### Docker

By default, the `main.py` script points to a custom [`dtbuchholz/wxm`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dtbuchholz/wxm/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated) image within the Bacalhau job configuration. You can also run `docker compose` if desired, which is provided in the Makefile commands noted below.

## Usage

### Docker

Use `docker compose` to run it on Docker:

```sh
make up
```

This will set up the Bacalhau job, pointing to the `dtbuchholz/wxm` image, and run the job defined at `job.py`. The job will fetch data from Tableland Basin, compute over it, and return computation results. It'll log something like the following:

```
Submitted job: 26a5f55f-dabd-490b-ba4b-59f14f746702
Waiting for job to finish...
Job finished; results at CID: QmdKf9z6URSRwSLUrehSKXAQCU1rwBqbKvpSfPpxzQ3QFq
// ...
```

To stop the job, run:

```sh
make down
```

### On your Machine

Or, to run the job directly on your machine, simply run the `main.py` program:

```sh
make local
```

This assumes that any changes in your project/image have been published to the Docker Hub, so make sure you run `make publish` in order to see those changes. If you're simply trying to see how the job _should_ run from a pure data analysis perspective, you can try running the job directly on your machine, without Bacalhau involved:

```sh
make job-local
```

### Makefile Reference

The following defines all commands available in the `Makefile`:

- `make install`: install dependencies.
- `make build`: build the image.
- `make up-build`: build the image using `docker compose` with `--no-cache`.
- `make publish`: publish the image to Docker Hub (note: the username is `dtbuchholz`, so replace with your own here as well as in the `build` step).
- `make up`: run the image using `docker compose`.
- `make down`: stop the image using `docker compose`.
- `make local`: run the program on your machine using Bacalhau.
- `make job-local`: run the program on your machine without using Bacalhau.
- `make freeze`: freeze dependencies (only needed if you make changes to dependencies).
